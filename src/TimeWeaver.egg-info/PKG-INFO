# TimeWeaver: Automated time series imputation <img src="./assets/logo.png" align="right" alt="TimeWeaver Logo" />

TimeWeaver is a Python library designed for multivariate time series data analysis, specifically addressing the challenges of machine process environmental data. It focuses on overcoming incomplete datasets due to sensor errors by employing various tailored imputation techniques. This ensures the integrity and relevance of data, catering to the unique characteristics of different features, such as discrepancies between power consumption and temperature curves.

TimeWeaver provides insightful graphics and analyses, enabling effective tool selection for specific data challenges, making it a valuable asset for data scientists and analysts. Additionally, it is evolving to offer a customizable Preprocessor model, facilitating the integration of optimal imputation methods into existing data processing pipelines for automated and enhanced data preparation.
